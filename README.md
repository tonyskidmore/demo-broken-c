# Demo C Project

## Introduction

This is a demo C project for a demonstration of using git.  

You need to fix it!

To execute the code from a Linux (or Windows with a C compiler installed) change into the directory and execute the script.  
In the code example below we are assuming a Linux system using the gcc compiler.  
*Note*: In the git demo the Git URL will be different.  Use the instructions in the demo. 

```
git clone https://github.com/tonyskidmore/demo-broken-c.git
cd demo-broken-c
gcc hello.c
./hello.o
```
